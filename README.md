# vocore eagle BRD files

Eagle BRD files for the VoCore and the VoCore dock, 7.x Eagle

notes:

	VIAs and drill sizes/restring need to be set for your board house.
	I'm using a temporary 4 layer DRC
	Layers are setup so shouldn't be any blind/buried vias

NOT BUILD TESTED - THERE WILL BE ERRORS!
